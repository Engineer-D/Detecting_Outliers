There are several ways to detecting outliers in a dataset
You can use any of the following

There are also several ways to correct,remove outliers

All this approaches have been used in the jupyter notebook the dataset I made use of is the Boston Dataset, 
which I imported from Sklearn inbuilt dataset.
